# QuantGoal AI (V2): The "Autonomous Hedge Fund" for Sports Prediction
**Comprehensive Project Overview & Architecture v2.0**

---

## 1. Executive Summary
**QuantGoal AI** is not a gambling site. It is the **"AI Central Bank"** and **"Credit Rating Agency"** for the sports world. 

In our **V2 Upgrade**, we treat every football match as a complex financial asset. We do not just provide "tips"; we issue **"Alpha Credit Ratings"** by synthesizing 6 elite AI models plus a dynamic Meta-Model. Our goal is to **price market errors**—identifying where public odds deviate from algorithmic reality.

**Core Value Prop:** 
> "We don’t just predict; we define and price market consensus errors."

## 2. Design Aesthetics & UI/UX
Our design philosophy is **"Bloomberg Terminal meets Cyberpunk"**. We prioritize data density, clarity, and a premium "High-Stakes" atmosphere.

### 2.1 Visual Identity
*   **Palette:** Deep Void Black (`#000000`) background with high-contrast neon accents.
    *   **Brand Gold:** Luxury, Wealth (VIP features).
    *   **Terminal Green:** Profit, +EV Signals, Money.
    *   **Signal Red:** Risk, Stop-Loss warnings.
*   **Typography:** Monospace fonts (JetBrains Mono) for all data points to emphasize precision; Sans-serif (Inter) for readability.
*   **Effects:** Glassmorphism headers, subtle "breathing" glows on live signals, and smooth micro-interactions.

### 2.2 User Experience (The "VIP Funnel")
*   **The Hook (Homepage):** Users see the "Upcoming Alpha Signals" immediately. They see **what** the AI is analyzing (Logic), but the **final verdict** (Target & Stake) is locked behind a blurred "VIP Glass Wall".
*   **The Narrative ($10k Challenge):** Instead of dry stats, we show the **Bankroll**. "DeepSeek AI started with $10k and is now at $12,400." This gamifies trust.
*   **The Deep Dive (War Room):** Clicking a match opens a professional command center, not just a betting tip.

## 3. Core Architecture: Synthetic Intelligence
We have evolved from a simple committee to a **Synthetic Intelligence Engine**.

### 3.1 The AI Central Bank (Decision Board)
We orchestrate a real-time competition between 6 world-class APIs, acting as our "Board of Governors":
1.  **DeepSeek V3 (Tactician):** xG & tactical mismatch specialist.
2.  **GPT-4o (Risk Officer):** Data stability & high-probability coverage.
3.  **Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Logicist):** Causal reasoning & extreme narrative rigour.
4.  **Gemini 2.0 Flash (Scout):** Live odds speed & team news scanner.
5.  **Qwen-Plus (Quant):** Value Gap calculation & implied probability.
6.  **ChatGPT-4.5 (Opportunist):** High-volatility market windows.
7.  **Meta-Model (Chair):** A dynamic weighted consensus that adjusts power based on daily calibration.

### 3.2 3-Layer Scientific Evaluation
1.  **Performance Layer:** Rankings based on **Sharpe Ratio** and **Max Drawdown**.
2.  **Capability Layer:** **"Capability Radar Charts"** for each AI (Home/Away, Spread, Live Adjustment).
3.  **Experimental Layer:** **Benchmark Model** (Market Efficiency baseline). AI must outperform the "Odds Average" to claim Alpha.

## 4. Feature Modules

### 4.1 "Alpha Credit Ratings" (Homepage)
*   **Mechanism:** Instead of "Win", we show a rating (e.g., AA+). 
*   **Divergence Index:** We display the entropy of the AI Board. High divergence = Market Chaos Warning.

### 4.2 Black Swan Options & Guilds
*   **Black Swan Options:** A virtual hedging tool based on the "Chaos Factor" (Entropy). Buy cheap "Insurance" against extreme upsets.
*   **Fund Guilds (Social Finance):** Join forces in collective fund pools. Compete as a team on the Guild Leaderboard.

### 4.3 Champion League (Leaderboard & Ledger)
*   **Mechanism:** Models are ranked by **Sharpe Ratio** and **Calmar Ratio** (Return/Max Drawdown).
*   **The Ledger:** Fully traceable "Audit Log" of every Diamond 4 pick.

## 5. Technical Stack

### Frontend
*   **Framework:** Next.js 14 (App Router) for server-side rendering and SEO.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + Lucide Icons.
*   **State Management:** React Context (for Auth/VIP status).

### Backend (The Brain)
*   **Language:** Python 3.10+.
*   **Orchestrator:** Custom `MultiDimensionalPredictionEngine` class.
*   **Data Persistence:** JSON-based flat-file database (for speed and portability).
*   **Simulation:** `seed_v2.py` script acts as the "Market Simulator", generating predictions and resolving bets to update bankrolls.
